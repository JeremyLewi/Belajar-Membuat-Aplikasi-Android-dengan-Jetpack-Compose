The Civic coupe is still considered a compact car. The Civic currently falls between the Honda Fit and Accord."

In Australia, this was due to the similarly named Mitsubishi Magna Elante model; similarly, in other markets, the name Avante is not used due to its similarity with Audi's \"Avant\" designation, which is used for their line of station wagons.
